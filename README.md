Features :-
Accepts user input for WBC and RBC counts.
Utilizes Cohere's AI model for generating potential disease predictions.
Provides a user-friendly interface through the command line.

Code Overview :-
Cohere Integration: The AI model is powered by Cohere's NLP API.
Prompt Function: Takes WBC and RBC counts as input and generates disease predictions.
Environment Variables: Used to securely manage the Cohere API key.
